# Hey, I'm Todd 👋

**I start things.**

## What I'm Up To

Currently wearing too many hats as CEO of three companies I co-founded:

- 🐛 **[TrackJS](https://trackjs.com/)** - Because JavaScript errors are inevitable
- 📊 **[Request Metrics](https://requestmetrics.com/)** - Because slow websites make me sad  
- 🔐 **[CertKit](https://www.certkit.io/)** - Because SSL certificates shouldn't require a PhD

## The Backstory

Started my career crimping ethernet cables and somehow ended up as an "enterprise architect" (still can't explain what that means). Spent years at Thomson Reuters and Toro learning that most enterprise solutions are just regular solutions with more meetings and higher prices.

Got tired of the corporate life, caught the startup bug, and haven't looked back.

## Sometimes I Teach Things

- 🎓 **[Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/todd-gardner/)** - Courses on web performance and debugging
- 🎤 **Conference Speaker** - They haven't figured out I'm making it up as I go
- 📝 **[Blog](https://www.toddhgardner.com/)** - Occasional rants about software and things that make me want to flip tables

## Fun Facts

- Hosted "Who Wants to be a JavaScriptaire?" at NDC Oslo (it went exactly as well as you'd expect)
- Have a Master's in Management of Technology (fancy way of saying "I can talk to engineers AND business people")
- Spend too much time plotting elaborate internet jokes
- Unironically enjoy PowerPoint
- My Home Assistant setup is getting out of hand
